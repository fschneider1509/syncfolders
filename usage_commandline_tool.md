Usage of commandline tool

# Introduction #

This wiki page is an introduction to the useage of the commandline version of syncfolders.


# Usage #

The usage of the tool is very simple:

**syncfolders** _</path/to/folder/a>_ _</path/to/folder/b>_

Note: Do not use a trailing slash at the end of each path. It is not necessary and will be automatically removed. The root folder of each path (last folder of the string) must be eqaul to the other one!

**Attention**: The tool is in alpha state, so please make a backup before you copy some data!!
