Introduction to syncfolders

# Introduction #

The development of this little peace of software was startet by me because i needed a tool to sync folders on my MacBook Pro with my Gentoo workstation.

First I had the idea when a was a student and wanted to have the same files on my Notebook when I was at the university as I have on my workstation.

Now I have enough time to make a running C program of this idea :).


# Targets #

The target of this project is to have a program wich I can use in batch-mode and with gui. The gui will be developed using GTK+. Some time ago I wrote some tools using the C++ toolkit Qt.
But like Linus Torvalds said on his Google+ page "I'm a C kind of person".

On my Gentoo workstation I use a lot of GTK+ apps and I like them very much (great look and feel), so this is the reason for my using GTK+ and trying something new.


# Release #
At this time (26th of November, 2011) there is no gui and the program is growing every day. Even the command line version is not runnig properly.
So the tool is neither in alpha status...there are only code snippets.
But I think (hope) that next week the first alpha version will be commited...:).
