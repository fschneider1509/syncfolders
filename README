syncfolders-gtk

This is a small tool for syncing two folders. The folders can be choosen by using the
fileopen-dialogs in the gui. The folders a recusively scanned and displayed in the 
treeview. 
For syncing the folders a breadth-first search is used.
The tool is written for Linux operating systems, but I think it will also work
on *BSD systems. I'll try and build it also on OS X. There is / will be no
windows version.

Needed software / libs:
- gcc
- make (GNU make)
- GTK+2.0 (in most distributions gtk-devel)
- glib
- glibc
- git

Building:

Building the tool is very easy, do the following steps:
1.) cd syncfolders/
2.) make
3.) ready :)

Start it with ./syncfolders-gtk.

The gui is written in GTK+-2.0. This is my first GTK program, so it is possible that
there will be some "ugly" code.

Attention: The copy function for files is very simple, the file attributes (e.g. access, etc.)
will not be copied.

Warning: There is absolutely no warranty. Before using the tool please make a backup.
